1. Review ticket title and description
2. If requested an estimation, place your estimate on the comment section and on the “Estimations” tab, fill the Estimation Accuracy, Estimate complexity, and Estimate risk. Once the PM approved it, you can now start working on it.
3. Once you finish working on the feature/bug, use the completion template to list down the preview links, theme name, how to test, and screenshots of your work. [!image](./images/submit-for-completion.png)
